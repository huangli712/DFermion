# DFermion

The DFermion software package implements a dual fermion framework for general lattice model. It can not work alone. It has to work with the [**iQIST**](https://github.com/huangli712/iQIST) software package.

This package is currently under developement. **PLEASE USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!**
